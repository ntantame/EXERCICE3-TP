                some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step. I
                 was help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a 
                 former student of their who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
                 entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had
                 to wait long for assistance. The agile team project,in particular, was
                 outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could
                 ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of
                 my development experience. It certifainly helped me land a job as full-stack
                 developper after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommanded! "
